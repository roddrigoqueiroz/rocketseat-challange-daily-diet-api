# Rocketseat Daily Diet API

Introducing the Rocketseat Daily Diet API Challenge:

In this challenge set forth by Rocketseat School, I undertook the task of developing a backend API. To accomplish this, I employed Node.js and TypeScript, creating a system that efficiently processes HTTP requests with the Fastify package. When it came to managing the database, I opted for SQLite3 and employed Knex for smooth database operations.

This project has been a valuable and rewarding experience, providing me with insights and skills for future endeavors in the realm of development. I look forward to sharing more exciting projects in the near future. ðŸš€ðŸŒŸ
